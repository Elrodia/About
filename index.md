# **One Founder. One Vision.**

Lightning Signals began quietly. No press releases. No hype. Just a relentless idea and one person at a keyboard.

Eric Vitrier, the solo founder, **is** the entire engineering team. He writes every line of code and deploys every server. No shortcuts, no outsourcing.

**- Back-End:** Node.js logic, MySQL databases, custom APIs, secure authentication – built from scratch.
**- Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React interface – crafted pixel by pixel.
**- Ops:** Git version control, DevOps pipelines, SSL encryption, deployments on Railway – all orchestrated solo.

Day after day, night after night, he works. Not because it's easy, but because it matters. There's no one else to blame, and no one else needed. When something breaks, he already knows how to fix it – he built it. When new features call, he answers with code. Every challenge is met head-on. Every victory earned with commit after commit.

Lightning Signals isn’t just an app. It’s a testament to uncompromising focus and personal accountability. The product of a one-man mission to prove that **one skilled developer can build something remarkable.** Lean, secure, and fiercely reliable – because its creator accepts nothing less.

The journey started slow, but momentum built with each line of code. What began as a spark is now a robust platform. Battle-tested, refined, and ready.

**No fluff. No corporate double-speak.** Just a founder who builds, unapologetically.

**This is Lightning Signals.** Built single-handedly by **Eric** – a badass founder who knows his craft. Driven by vision, executed with skill, and delivered with pride.

It stands strong – so you can depend on it.
